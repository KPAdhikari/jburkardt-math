      FROBENIUS <br> Routines for the Frobenius Problem
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>FROBENIUS</b> is a collection of Mathematica routines for the solution
      of Frobenius's problem.
    </p>

    <p>
      Frobenius's problem assumes that there are <b>N</b> denominations of
      coins, <b>A<sub>1</sub></b> through <b>A<sub>N</sub></b>, and asks for
      the largest quantity that <i>cannot</i> be formed using any combination
      of the coins.
    </p>

    <p>
      It is assumed that the denominations are all positive integers.
    </p>

    <p>
      The problem
      is "impossible" if the denominations have a common factor greater than 1 -
      impossible in the sense that in this case there are an infinite number of
      quantitities that cannot be formed.  On the other hand, if the denominations
      do not all share a common factor greater than 1, then there is always a
      finite solution, that is, a largest quantity that cannot be formed by
      the denominations.  In this case, the value is called the <b>Frobenius number</b>,
      and symbolized by <b>g(<b>A<sub>1</sub></b>,<b>A<sub>2</sub></b>,...<b>A<sub>N</sub></b>)</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      The case of two denominations is easy:
      <blockquote><b>
        g(a,b) = a*b - a - b
      </b></blockquote>
      However, the case of three denominations is hard, and for general N, the
      problem is NP-hard!
    </p>

    <p>
      In an example inspired by the "denominations" of McDonald's MacNuggets,
      there are 3 denominations, 6, 9, and 20, and it can be shown that the
      number 43 is the largest value that cannot be formed by combinations of
      these denominations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Note that Mathematica has a built in command that can compute the
      Frobenius number:
      <blockquote><code>
        FrobeniusNumber [ { 6, 9, 20 } ]
      </code></blockquote>
