      BUCKLING_SPRING <br> The Buckling Spring
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>BUCKLING_SPRING</b> is a Mathematica program
      which illustrates solutions of the buckling spring equations.
    </p>

    <p>
      We are given three points A, B, and C:
      <ul>
        <li>
          A is at the origin (0,0);
        </li>
        <li>
          B has coordinates (X,Y) with Y nonnegative, and the ray from A to B
          makes an angle of THETA with the horizontal axis.
        </li>
        <li>
          C is at the point (2*X,0).
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Springs:
      <ul>
        <li>
          A spring extends from A to B; it is normally of length 1, and is
          currently of length L.
        </li>
        <li>
          A spring extends from B to C; it is normally of length 1, and is
          currently of length L.
        </li>
        <li>
          A spring force is also exerted, which tends to draw the two
          springs together, proportional to the angle between the two springs.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Forces:
      <li>
          A vertical load MU is applied at point B (downward is positive);
        </li>
        <li>
          A horizontal load LAMBDA is applied at point C (leftware is positive);
        </li>
        <li>
          The spring force is applied perpendicularly to the axes of the two springs.
      </li>
    </p>

    <p>
      If we compute F(1), the force along the axis of one spring, and
      F(2), the force perpendicular to the axis of one spring, we have that
      F(L,THETA,LAMBDA,MU) is given by:
      <ul>
        <li>
          F(1) =  - 2 ( 1 - L ) + 2 * LAMBDA * cos ( THETA ) + MU * sin ( THETA )
        </li>
        <li>
          F(2) =  0.5 * THETA - 2 * LAMBDA * L * sin ( THETA ) + MU * L * cos ( THETA )
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      To explore these equations, we can first solve for MU and LAMBDA in terms
      of L and THETA:
      <ul>
        <li>
          LAMBDA(L,THETA) = (1-L) * cos(THETA) + 0.25 * THETA * sin(THETA) / L
        </li>
        <li>
          MU(L,THETA) = 2 * (1-L) * sin(THETA) - 0.5 * THETA * cos(THETA) / L
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      We can then study the behavior of solutions by choosing a fixed value of
      THETA (say pi/8), and plotting LAMBDA(L,THETA) versus MU(L,THETA) over a range
      of values of L, say from 0.25 to 1.75.  Recall that L = 1 when the springs
      are at their "natural" length.
