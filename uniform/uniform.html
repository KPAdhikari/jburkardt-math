      UNIFORM <br> A Uniform Random Number Generator
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>UNIFORM</b> is a Mathematica library
      which return a sequence of uniformly
      distributed pseudorandom numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      The fundamental underlying random number generator in <b>UNIFORM</b> 
      is based on a simple, old, and limited linear congruential random 
      number generator originally used in the IBM System 360.
    </p>

    <p>
      FORTRAN90 already has the <b>random_number</b> function, which can 
      return pseudorandom numbers rapidly, in bulk, and generally with
      less correlation than <b>UNIFORM</b> provides.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, this library makes it possible to compare certain computations 
      that use uniform random numbers, written in C, C++, FORTRAN77,
      FORTRAN90 or MATLAB.
    </p>

    <p>
      Various types of random data can be computed.  The routine names
      are chosen to indicate the corresponding type:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>C4</b>, complex ( kind = 4 )
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>C8</b>, complex ( kind = 8 )
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>CH</b>, character
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>I4</b>, integer ( kind = 4 )
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>I8</b>, integer ( kind = 8 )
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>R4</b>, real ( kind = 4 )
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>R8</b>, real ( kind = 8 )
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      In some cases, a one dimension vector or two dimensional
      array of values is to be generated, and part of the name
      will therefore include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>VEC</b>, vector;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>MAT</b>, a matrix of data;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The underlying random numbers are generally defined over some
      unit interval or region.  Routines are available which return
      these "unit" values, while other routines allow the user to
      specify limits between which the unit values are rescaled.
      If a routine returns unit values, its name will include
      a special indicator:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>01</b>, the data that is being returned lies in a
          unit interval or region;
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The random number generator embodied here is not very sophisticated.
      It will not have the best properties of distribution, noncorrelation
      and long period.  It is not the purpose of this library to achieve
      such worthy goals.  This is simply a reasonably portable library
      that can be implemented in various languages, on various machines,
      and for which it is possible, for instance, to regard the output
      as a function of the seed, and moreover, to work directly with
      the sequence of seeds, if necessary.

      Package Installation:
    </h3>

    <p>
      In order for the package to be accessible, the package file
      must be placed in the appropriate place.  A typical place is
      the "Applications" subdirectory of the "User Base Directory".
      These are directories set up by Mathematica.  You can find out
      where the User Base Directory is by the Mathematica command:
      <pre>
        $UserBaseDirectory
      </pre>
      Then you need to copy the package file to the "Applications"
      subdirectory of that directory.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the new package has been placed, you should probably run
      Mathematica and direct it to rebuild the Help database.  This
      will serve to update Mathematica's internal information so that
      it can explain how the functions in the package are called.
    </p>

      Package Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      To use the Uniform functions, the user must first load the package,
      with the command
      <pre>
        &lt;&lt; Uniform.m
      </pre>
      after which, for the duration of the Mathematica session, the
      user can invoke the functions with commands like
      <pre>
        new_seed = I4Uniform01[12345]
      </pre>
      or
      <pre>
        r4 = R4Uniform01[12345]
      </pre>
    </p>
