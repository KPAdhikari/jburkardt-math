      COLLATZ <br> A Simple Package for the Collatz Sequence
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>COLLATZ</b> is a Mathematica package which evaluates the
      Collatz sequence for a given starting point.
    </p>

    <p>
      The most interesting thing about <b>COLLATZ</b> is not the
      Collatz sequence, but rather the way that it demonstrates how
      a user can define new functions for Mathematica, to be stored
      in a package file, and accessed later by, for example, a notebook.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Collatz sequence itself, sometimes called the "3N+1" sequence,
      is defined as follows.  Choose a starting value <b>n</b>, a positive
      integer.  Now compute the next value of <b>n</b>:
      <ul>
        <li>
          If the current value of <b>n</b> is 1, stop.  The sequence
          has terminated.
        </li>
        <li>
          If <b>n</b> is even, the next element is <b>n/2</b>;
        </li>
        <li>
          If <b>n</b> is odd, the next element is <b>3*n+1</b>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      For every starting value of <b>n</b>, the sequence seems to terminate,
      and it is conjectured that this is always so.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, we are much more interested in the steps necessary to
      make it possible for a user to be able to start up Mathematica,
      and type 
      <pre>
        Collatz[17]
      </pre>
      and see the appropriate sequence of values.
    </p>

      Package Installation:
    </h3>

    <p>
      A package is a group of Mathematica function definitions.  Packages have
      a specific format; for instance, they are delimited with  
      <b>BeginPackage[]</b> and <b>EndPackage[]</b> statements.  Moreover,
      (and I forget this every time!) the cells in a package must be explicitly
      designated as "Initialization Cells" or nothing in the package will actually
      be usable.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order for a package to be accessible, it must be placed in a specific
      directory where Mathematica can find it.  Generally, this is the <b>Applications</b>
      subdirectory of the user base directory, which can be determined by:
      <pre>
        $UserBaseDirectory
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the new package has been placed, you should probably run
      Mathematica and direct it to rebuild the Help database.  This
      will serve to update Mathematica's internal information so that
      it can explain how the functions in the package are called.
    </p>

      Package Usage:
    </h3>

    <p>
      To use the Collatz function, the user must first load the package,
      with the command
      <pre>
        &lt;&lt; Collatz.m
      </pre>
      after which, for the duration of the Mathematica session, the
      user can invoke the Collatz function with commands like
      <pre>
        Collatz[99]
      </pre>
