      TIMESTAMP <br> Print a Timestamp

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>TIMESTAMP</b> is a Mathematica routine which prints the
      current YMDHMS date (year-month-day-hours-minutes-seconds)
      as a timestamp.
    </p>

    <p>
      This is useful when documenting the run of a program.  By
      including a timestamp, the output of the program will always
      contain a clear indication of when it was created.  Other
      indicators, such as the file modification timestamp, may be
      misleading or subject to unintentional modification.

      Package Installation:
    </h3>

    <p>
      In order for the package to be accessible, the package file
      must be placed in the appropriate place.  A typical place is
      the "Applications" subdirectory of the "User Base Directory".
      These are directories set up by Mathematica.  You can find out
      where the User Base Directory is by the Mathematica command:
      <pre>
        $UserBaseDirectory
      </pre>
      Then you need to copy the package file to the "Applications"
      subdirectory of that directory.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the new package has been placed, you should probably run
      Mathematica and direct it to rebuild the Help database.  This
      will serve to update Mathematica's internal information so that
      it can explain how the functions in the package are called.
