      CALENDARS <br> Routines for Calendrical Computations
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>CALENDARS</b> is a collection of several Mathematica packages 
      which can be used for simple
      calendrical calculations, including computing the number of days
      that have elapsed between two dates, or converting a date from one calendar to another.
    </p>

    <p>
      A package is a group of Mathematica function definitions.  Packages have
      a specific format; for instance, they are delimited with  
      <b>BeginPackage[]</b> and <b>EndPackage[]</b> statements.  Moreover,
      (and I forget this every time!) the cells in a package must be explicitly
      designated as "Initialization Cells" or nothing in the package will actually
      be usable.
    </p>

    <p>
      In order for a package to be accessible, it must be placed in a specific
      directory where Mathematica can find it.  Generally, this is the <b>Applications</b>
      subdirectory of the user base directory, which can be determined by:
      <pre>
        SetDirectory[$UserBaseDirectory]
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      The functions defined in a package are made available by using
      a special command, such as
      <pre>
        << SimplestCalendar
      </pre>
    </p>

    <p>
      Once the new package has been placed, you should probably run
      Mathematica and direct it to rebuild the Help database.  This
      will serve to update Mathematica's internal information so that
      it can explain how the functions in the package are called.
