      ARBITRARY_WEIGHT_RULE <br> Gauss Quadrature Rules for Arbitrary Weights
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>ARBITRARY_WEIGHT_RULE</b> is a Mathematica package which 
      accepts a formula for an arbitrary (but nonnegative) weight function 
      over an interval, and determines the points and weights of a
      corresponding Gaussian quadrature rule,
      by Fukuda, Katsuya, Alt and Matveenko.
    </p>

    <p>
      The integral to be approximated has the form
      <blockquote>
        If = Integral ( a &lt; x z&lt; b ) f(z(x)) w(x) dx 
      </blockquote>
      where <b>a</b> is allowed to be -oo, and <b>b</b> is allowed
      to be +oo.  The function <b>z(x)</b> is a monotonic (that is,
      invertible) function of <b>x</b> introduced for convenience.
      The weight function <b>w(x)</b> is assumed to be positive
      everywhere within the range, except perhaps for isolated
      points where it may be zero.
    </p>

    <p>
      A Gauss quadrature rule Q of order <b>n</b> is a set of points 
      <b>x<sub>i</sub></b> and weights <b>w<sub>i</sub></b>
      which approximate the integral <b>If</b> by
      <blockquote>
        If approx Qf = Sum ( 1 &lt;= i &lt;= n ) w<sub>i</sub> f(z(x<sub>i</sub>))
      </blockquote>
      with the property that the approximation is exact in cases where
      <b>f(z(x))</b> is a polynomial of degree 2*<b>n</b>-1 or less.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Mathematica program is not interactive.  To be used, it
      requires the user to modify the text of the program to specify
      certain quantities.
    </p>

    <p>
      Quantities the user must specify include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>a</b> and <b>b</b>, the integration limits;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>w(x)</b>, the formula for the weight;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>u=z(x)</b>, the formula for the transformation;
          In most cases, <b>u=x</b> can be used;
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>zi(u)</b>, the formula for the inverse transformation;
          In most cases, <b>zi=u</b> can be used.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>n</b>, the order of the desired Gauss quadrature rule.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      Other quantities which the user may wish to change, but which
      are already set to reasonable values, include:
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Nm</b>, the internal precision (number of digits of accuracy)
          for the moments (set to 50);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Nz</b>, the internal precision (number of digits of accuracy)
          for the Jacobi matrix (set to 25);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Na</b>, the final precision (number of digits of accuracy)
          in the abscissas and weights of the rule (set to 17);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>outputww</b>, set to 0 for the weights, or 1 for the
          weights divided by W(x) (set to 0);
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>fortranfname</b>, the name of the file to be created,
          containing a FORTRAN77 program that defines the abscissas
          and weights (set to "gqxw.f");
        </li>
      </ul>
