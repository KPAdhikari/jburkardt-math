      LORENZ_EQUATIONS <br> The Lorenz Equations
    </h1>

    <hr>

    <p>
      <b>LORENZ_EQUATIONS</b> is a collection of Mathematica routines 
      which investigate and display the behavior of solutions to the Lorenz equations.
    </p>

    <p>
      The Lorenz equations are an extremely simplified model of the weather,
      in which three differential equations describe the evolution of three
      variables.  There are also three parameters whose values play the role
      of physical constants.  
    </p>

    <p>
      It was while studying these equations that Edward Lorenz discovered
      what he called "deterministic chaos".  That is, at least for certain
      values of the parameters, solutions were extremely sensitive to the
      initial conditions.  
    </p>

    <p>
      The Lorenz equations are often written as
      <pre>
        x' = sigma * ( y - x )
        y' = x * ( rho - z ) - y
        z' = x * y - beta * z
      </pre>
      where the parameters are positive.  Typical values for the parameters are
      <pre>
        sigma = 10
        beta = 8 / 3 = 2.666...
        rho = 28
      </pre>
      The value of rho has a strong influence on the behavior of solutions.
      The value rho=28 results in chaotic solutions, whereas rho=99.96 yields
      a regular pattern.
